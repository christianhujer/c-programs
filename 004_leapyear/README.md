# 004 Leap Year

Note: This is not the most elegant form of the algorithm.
See the next two versions, [005_leapyear](../005_leapyear/) and [006_leapyear](../006_leapyear) for better versions.

Also note: In real world projects, the test code and the production code would live in separate files, and different test cases would be executable separately.
We will learn later how to do that.

## 3 Laws of TDD
> 1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
> 1. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
> 1. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## New Elements
- Research your requirements (in this case, for example, first research the rules for leap years).
- Use `<assert.h>` to get access to the `assert()` macro.
- Use `<stdbool.h>` to get access to the `bool` type and the `true` and `false` constants.
- Use the `assert()` macro to verify assumptions about the behavior of code.
- First define your assumptions, verify them, and then implement them.
  That is called TDD - Test-Driven Development
