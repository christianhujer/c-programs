# 011 Types

This program prints the sizes of the various types arithmetic types.
The arithmetic types defined by ISO/IEC 9899:202x are:
- `_Bool`, large enough to store the values 0 and 1
- The _standard signed integer types_ `signed char`, `short int`, `int`, `long int`, and `long long int`.
- The _standard unsigned integer types_ `unsigned char`, `unsigned short int`, `unsigned int`, `unsigned long int`, `unsigned long long int`, and `_Bool`.
- The standard signed integer types and the standard unsigned integer types are collectively called the _standard integer types_.
- The _standard floating types_ `float`, `double`, and `long double` (which typically adhere to _IEEE 754_ aka _ISO/IEC 60559_).
- The integer and floating types are colelctively called _arithmetic types_.
