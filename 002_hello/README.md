# 002 hello

This is a slightly improved version of the "Hello, world!" program.
Instead of relying on the implicit behavior that `main()` returns `0` when reaching its end,
we are explicitly expressing the intent of telling the hosted environment that our program completed successfully.

## New elements
- Include the `<stdlib.h>` library header to get access to general standard library definitions like `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE`.
- Use `return EXIT_SUCCESS` (or `exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)`) to explicitly indicate successful completion of the program to the hosted environment.
- The 4 Rules of Simple Design show us that communicating intent is more important than no duplicaton or fewest elements.
  Therefore, a version of the "Hello, world!" program that explicitly does `return EXIT_SUCCESS` is better (more readable).
